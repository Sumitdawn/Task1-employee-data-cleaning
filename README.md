📊 Employee Data Cleaning Project
🧹 Objective:
This project demonstrates the process of cleaning and preparing a raw employee dataset using Python (Pandas). The raw data contained missing values, inconsistent formatting, and duplicate records, which were systematically cleaned to create a ready-to-analyze dataset.

📁 Dataset Overview
File Name: employee_raw_dataset.csv

Records: 1000+ (with intentional noise: duplicates, missing values, format issues)

Fields Included:

1.Employee ID

2.Name

3.Age

4.Gender

5.Department

6.Salary

7.Joining Date

8.Country

🛠️ Tools Used
1.Python

2.Pandas

3.NumPy

4.Jupyter Notebook 

🔍 Cleaning Process Highlights
1.Missing Values

  Handled missing numerical fields using median imputation

  Categorical blanks filled with "Unknown" or "Not Specified"

  Blank or malformed dates set to a default or most frequent value

2.Duplicates

  Removed duplicate records using .drop_duplicates()

  Inconsistent Text Formats

  Standardized values in Gender, Country, and Department

3.Date Formatting

  Converted Joining Date to a consistent datetime format

4.Column Cleanup

  Renamed columns to lowercase and snake_case (e.g., joining_date)

  Checked and enforced appropriate data types

💡 Future Improvements
Integrate with a dashboard (e.g., Power BI or Streamlit)

Automate cleaning with functions and config files

Add unit tests to validate each cleaning step
